# Obsidian.nvim

A Neovim plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), written in Lua.

## Features

- ▶️ Autocompletion for note references via [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) (triggered by typing `[[`)
- 🏃 Go to a note buffer with `gf` when cursor is on a reference
- 💅 Additional markdown syntax highlighting and concealing for references

### In-progress

- [ ] Command for getting backlinks to current buffer
- [ ] Command for creating daily notes

## Setup

### Requirements

The plugin [plenary.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim) is required, and if you want completion features (recommended) you'll also need [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) to be installed and on your `$PATH`.
See [ripgrep#installation](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) for install options.

### Install

Using `vim-plug`, for example:

```vim
Plug 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim'  " required
Plug 'hrsh7th/nvim-cmp'       " optional, for completion
Plug 'godlygeek/tabular'      " optional, needed for 'preservim/vim-markdown'
Plug 'preservim/vim-markdown' " optional, recommended for syntax highlighting, folding, etc.
Plug 'epwalsh/obsidian.nvim'
```

### Configuration

For a minimal configuration, just add:

```lua
require("obsidian").setup({
  dir = "~/my-vault",
  completion = {
    nvim_cmp = true, -- if using nvim-cmp, otherwise set to false
  }
})
```

:exclamation: Note that you do **not** need to specify this plugin as an `nvim-cmp` "source".
Obsidian.nvim will set itself up as a source automatically when you enter a markdown buffer within your vault directory.

```lua
require("cmp").setup({
  sources = {
    { name = "obsidian" }, -- WRONG! Don't put this here. Obsidian configures itself for nvim-cmp
  },
})
```
